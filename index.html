					<p>In this class I'll teach you how to think like a designer. You'll learn what designers do, how they do it, and how to do some of the things they do. We'll focus on the design of user interfaces and information systems. By the end of the course you won't be a <i>great</i> designer, but you'll learn what you need to <i>practice</i> to become a great designer. This will empower you to learn more about design by engaging more deeply in the <a href="https://www.uxseattle.org/">Puget Sound UX design community</a>.</p>
				
					<p>The structure of this course is simple:</p>
	
					<ol>
						<li>I teach you about design for 5 weeks through a series of readings and in-class practice.</li>
						<li>A midterm to see how much you learned.</li>
						<li>With a teammate, you design something useful for one of your classmates.</li>
						<li>With a teammate, you write a design specification that details your design thoroughly.</li>
						<li>With a teammate, you create a video prototype that communicates your design persuasively.</li>
					</ol>
										
					<p>Sound good? Let's get started!</p>

					<h2>Office Hours</h2>
					
					<p>My office hours this quarter are <b>Wednesdays 10:00-12:00</b> at CSE 218. Please, write me at least 24 hours in advance to secure your 30 minutes slot. (If this does not work for you, talk to me after class or write me: we will figure something out.)</p>

					<h2>Devices in Class</h2>
					
					<p>We will use smartphones and laptops throughout the quarter to facilitate activities and project work in-class. <b>However</b>, research and student feedback clearly shows that using devices on non-class related activities not only harms your own learning, but other students' learning as well. Therefore, I only allow device usage during activities that require devices. At all other times, you should not be using your device. I'll help you remember this by announcing when to bring devices out and when to put them away.</p>

					<p>Note that 70% of your grade is individual and 30% is team. If you do perfectly on the individual parts of the class and contribute nothing to the project, you can't pass the class. So be a good design partner!
	
					<p><strong>Late work receives no credit</strong>. There are some exceptions:</p>

					<ul>					
						<li>If you can provide a note from a health care professional documenting the reason for your absence, I may accept late submissions (but not for activities, since those can't be reproduced).</li>
						<li>You can <strong>miss up to 3 activities</strong> without penalty and without documentation. This should be enough to allow for sickness, unavoidable travel, or other personal matters.</li>
						<li>If you miss a reading quiz, you can make up the quiz credit by sending a critique of the reading to me within a week of the due date that reports at least three improvements to the content, including high level issues such as topics that should be discussed or points you think are wrong, to low level issues including spelling, grammar, or clarity.</li>
					</ul>

					<h2 id="activities">Activities</h2>
					
					<p>Each day in class we'll practice some skill. You'll get <a href="#grading">1 point</a> if you engage in and complete the activity. How to get credit for the activity will depend on the activity; sometimes being present will be enough, sometimes being to class on time will be enough, and sometimes you'll have to turn something in. Because there aren't exactly 30 class periods in class, the total number of points you receive will be scaled to 30 points as follows: <code>(30 x (# activity points earned) / (# of activity points possible))</code>.</p>
					
					<h2 id="reading">Reading</h2>
					
					<p>Readings are due twice a week, and each time, involve reading two things: 1) the chapter from <a href="https://faculty.washington.edu/ajko/books/design-methods/index.html">Andy Ko's open book</a> pointed our in our schedule and 2) something related to the chapter, selected from links in the chapter, or from anything else in the world (but you have to find it).
					
					<p>The day that each reading is due, we'll do the following:</p>
					
					<ul>
						<li>Share what you're confused about.</li>
						<li>We clarify confusions.</li>
						<li>I give you a question to answer individually about the assigned reading.</li>
						<li>You spend 5 minutes writing a polished answer, using only the knowledge in your head.</li>
						<li>You turn in your answer.</li>
						<li>You discuss your answer with your neighbor.</li>
						<li>We discuss the correct answer as a class.</li>
					</ul>
					
					<p>If your answer is correct, you'll receive <a href="#grading">1 point</a>. I will give partial credit for partially correct answers, at my discretion.</p>
					
					<p>Your selected reading assignment is <i>your</i> choice. Before class, read <b>one</b> of the articles linked in the reading <b>or</b> choosing something design-related book, blog post, magazine article, newspaper article, or online video that that is relevant to the topic of the chapter. If you choose a book, it's okay to just read the first chapter of the book. For your additional 1 point of reading credit, submit to Canvas a summary of no more than 500 words that:</p>
					
					<ul>
						<li>Summarizes the point of the article.</li>
						<li>Describes the thing you found most interesting about the article.</li>
						<li>Includes a citation to what you read.</li>
					</ul>
					
					<p>In class, after we discuss the assigned reading, we will:</p>
					
					<ul>
						<li>Break into groups of four</li>
						<li>Discuss your selected readings as a group, identifying one insight from the readings that connect with the topic of the day to share with the class</li>
						<li>Elect someone to share the insights with the class.</li>
						<li>We'll hear from 3-4 groups about their most interesting insight.</li>
					</ul>
	
					<h2 id="midterm">Midterm</h2>
					
					<!--p>The midterm will be the same exam that I gave you on the first day of class. It will cover every topic in the assigned readings and every skill practiced in class. The midterm score will not be curved or scaled; however, any questions that more than 80% of students in the class get wrong will be excluded from the final score as they were likely confusing or concerned material that I poorly taught.</p-->
					
					<p>The purpose of the midterm is to find out what you know, not to penalize you for not knowing something. To this end, for every question you get wrong on the midterm, you can earn half the credit you lost by submitting to Canvas, for each problem:</p>
					
					<ol>
						<li>The question</li>
						<li>Your answer</li>
						<li>How many points you lost on the answer</li>
						<li>Why your answer was wrong</li>
					</ol>
					
					<p>If your explanation is correct, you'll receive half of your points back. You'll submit these on Canvas no later than 2 weeks after the midterm.</p>
